  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently asked questions",
    "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about automation",
    "q1": "What is business process automation?",
    "a1": "Automation involves connecting your tools and applications so they work together without human intervention. For example: automatically syncing CRM leads with your email tool, generating daily reports, or notifying your team on Slack when a sale is made.",
    "q2": "Which automation tools do you use?",
    "a2": "We primarily work with n8n, Make (formerly Integromat), and Zapier. We choose the most suitable tool based on your needs, budget, and existing systems. For complex requirements, we also develop custom solutions with Python or Node.js.",
    "q3": "How long does it take to automate my processes?",
    "a3": "A simple workflow can be set up in 1-2 days. Complex automations with multiple integrations typically take 1-3 weeks. We always start by identifying your priority processes for quick results.",
    "q4": "What is the return on investment (ROI)?",
    "a4": "Most of our clients see positive ROI within 2-4 months through time saved. For example: automating 10 hours/week of repetitive tasks represents 40-50 hours/month saved. We calculate projected ROI during our free initial audit.",
    "q5": "Can my current tools be automated?",
    "a5": "Very likely! Modern tools (CRM, ERP, marketing tools, accounting, etc.) have APIs enabling integration. Even older tools can often be connected via email, webhooks, or CSV files. We conduct a free technical audit to validate feasibility.",
    "q6": "What happens if my workflows break down?",
    "a6": "We implement 24/7 monitoring with automatic alerts. In case of errors, we're notified instantly and intervene quickly. All our maintenance packages include priority support with guaranteed SLAs.",
    "q7": "Will automation replace my employees?",
    "a7": "No, automation frees your teams from low-value repetitive tasks so they can focus on strategic activities requiring creativity and human judgment. The goal is to increase productivity, not replace people.",
    "q8": "How much does process automation cost?",
    "a8": "Pricing varies by complexity: simple workflows from €500-1500, medium automations €2000-5000, complex projects €5000-15000. We also offer recurring monthly packages to continuously manage and improve your automations.",
    "q9": "Can I modify my workflows myself afterward?",
    "a9": "Absolutely! We include comprehensive training so your team can adjust and maintain workflows. We document everything and remain available for support. You're never stuck if you want to evolve your processes.",
    "q10": "How do I get started with automation?",
    "a10": "Contact us for a free 30-minute audit. We identify your most time-consuming processes, estimate potential time savings, and propose a prioritized automation plan. You receive a detailed proposal within 48 hours with projected ROI."
